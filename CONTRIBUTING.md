## Contributing Code

The best place to start is by looking at the [Samplify Integration board](https://app.asana.com/0/1143497512179452/board), which is for the initial build. If you decide to take on a task make sure to assign it to yourself so we don't duplicate work. A good PR completely resolves the associated Asana issue, passes or python linting, and includes test coverage for your new code. This Github repository is integrated with CircleCI, so a PR cannot be accepted that has merge conflicts, fails to pass linting or tests, or lowers the repository's test coverage. Additionally your PR should include a high level description of your or reviewers will be peppering you with questions, if this is something someone might have a question about in the future then go ahead and add this information to the [docs](docs). Approval of the maintainer is required merge a PR into `dev`, which is where all PRs go. 

## Linting

Linting software is strongly recommended to improve code quality and maintain readability in Python projects. Python's official linting package is called pycodestyle, but another useful linting package is called flake8. Flake8 runs three different linters on your code, including pycodestyle, and a package called PyFlakes that checks for things like unused imports.
